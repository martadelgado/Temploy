# **Project 2 | Temploy**

## Introduction

As part of our Web development Project week 2, we developed a web application in pairs.

Our web app is a job sharing website where small and location irrelevant tasks/jobs can be posted and accepted by other users.

Within this project we applied and made use of topics that we have learned in the first two modules of the course, such as: HTML, CSS, Javascript, express and mongodb as well as using Bootstrap.


## Setup

* npm install
* install packages
* good to go



## Temploy

The general idea of Temploy is that it is a job sharing web application. Basically, whatever you need help with or simplifying your todo list that is not bound to a location can be posted as a task and taken on by another fellow user who feels confident in doing the job for you and on the side earns some money. There is a whole list of job categories that range from digital marketing, Graphics & Design, Video Animation, Business and research studies as well as writing and translation tasks.
Therefore, Temploy creates a win-win situation for both the "Temployer" and the "Temployee".



## Application Status

We had one week to develop the application. Therefore, the current status of the platform is very basic and is missing a lot of our planned features.
At this point a user can:
- create Profile
- login
- post a job
- apply for a job
- edit Profile
- delete and edit job
- upload picture



## Challenges

Throughout the project we faced many different challenges that were both code related as well as timing related.
Since we are very new to web development of course every part of such a project is challenging, yet many issues could have been avoided by more careful initial planning.
